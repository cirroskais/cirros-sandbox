## Loading Screen

Make sure to run `yarn run build` inside of the `web/` folder. (It's a submodule!)

## FastDL

You're going to want to use another one of my projects, [gmod-addon-scripts](https://github.com/cirroskais/gmod-addon-scripts).  
Just set the environment variables, run `bun run download` and `bun run fastdl` after specifying your Workshop File IDs in `src/download.ts`.
